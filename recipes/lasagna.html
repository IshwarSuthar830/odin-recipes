    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Lasagna is a classic Italian dish made from layers of wide, flat pasta sheets, alternating with rich fillings. Traditionally, it features a savory mixture of ground meat (such as beef or pork), tomato-based sauce, creamy bechamel, and a variety of cheeses, usually mozzarella, Parmesan, and ricotta. The layers are baked together until the top is golden and bubbly, creating a hearty, flavorful casserole with a comforting, melt-in-your-mouth texture. Lasagna can be customized with vegetables, different meats, or even made vegetarian, making it a versatile favorite in both casual and special meals.</p>
